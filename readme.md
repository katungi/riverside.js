# RiverSide.JS

Riverside is a toy project on learning how to work with Next.js

It is a SSR framework and is intended to work almost the same as Next.js

You can find the full tutorial [here](https://frontend.blog/building-an-ssr-framework-using-vite-prisma/)

Tools:

In this dummy framework we use:

- Prisma
- Vite
- Typescript
- Express

I highly recommend Next.js though, Check out it's [docs](https://nextjs.org/) to get started.

Have fun!
